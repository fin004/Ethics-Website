        Computers in the workforce, The use of computers in the workplace has always had its equal share of advocates and critics. With the introduction of computerisation starting as early as the 1950s, the LEO I (Lyons electronic office I) was the first computer used for commercial business applications, and becoming more prominent in 1960s, those in favour of the new technology revolution argued that it would promote increased productivity, greater efficiency, speed, and accuracy. However, those against the very same technology claimed that there was potential for economic disaster, forecasting and focussing on the massive numbers of jobs likely to be lost as a result of these ‘unnecessary’ sweeping changes. Whilst both arguments were technically correct, technology and technological enhancements themselves are actually the source of substantial new markets and businesses. Unsurprisingly, humans are often incredibly good at adapting to these changes.
